My app is called movie reader. The aim of this project is to allow users to find information about American movies that were made in the early 1980's to the early 2000's. This user is able to research the movie based on its title, the year it was made, and a key word that describes the movie. After that a list is created with these movies and avaible for the user to choose. The id number of the movie in the movies data base, the movie title, the genres of the move, the year it was produced, the actors in the movie, and the plot are returned based on the user's search.
